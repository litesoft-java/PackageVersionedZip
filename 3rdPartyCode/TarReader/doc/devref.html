<h2>Java Tar Developer Reference</h2>

The
<a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/com/ice/tar/package-summary.html">Java Tar pacakge</a>
is written to be very similar to the
<a href="http://www.gjt.org/apidoc/java/util/zip/package-summary.html">java.util.zip</a>
package.

<h2><a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/com/ice/tar/TarEntry.html">TarEntry</a></h2>
TarEntry objects are similar to
<a href="http://www.gjt.org/apidoc/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html">ZipEntry</a>
objects. They represent an item in a tar archive.
They come from a <code>TarInputStream.getNextEntry()</code>.

<h2><a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/com/ice/tar/TarHeader.html">TarHeader</a></h2>
TarHeader objects are simply place holders (data structures) for the
header information of a TarEntry. Methods are provided for
parsing headers from tar archives, as well as generating
headers from file information.

<h2><a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/com/ice/tar/TarInputStream.html">TarInputStream</a></h2>
TarInputStream is a subclass of
<a href="http://www.gjt.org/apidoc/java/io/FilterInputStream.html">FilterInputStream</a>.
TarInputStream is very similar to
<a href="http://www.gjt.org/apidoc/java/util/zip/ZipInputStream.html">ZipInputStream</a>
in the way it presents the tar archive concept to you.

<p>
To read a tar archive, you open a TarInputStream, then loop
using <code>getNextEntry()</code>, followed by a <code>read()</code> of
the contents of the entry. The read method will return EOF (-1) at the
end of each entry, at which time you loop to the next entry.


<h2><a href="http://www.gjt.org/javadoc/com/ice/tar/TarBuffer.html">TarBuffer</a></h2>
TarBuffer class is used to implement the blocked I/O of tar. This is done
to ensure that Java Tar is as compatible as possible with other
tar implementations.
